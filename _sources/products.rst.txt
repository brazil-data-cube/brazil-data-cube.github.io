BDC Data Products
=================


Brazil Data Cube (BDC) project is a Brazililian National Institute for Space Research (INPE) initiative to produce a Virtual Constellation, which uses data from the Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI), Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), CBERS-4 Advanced Wide-Field Imager (AWFI), CBERS-4 Multispectral Camera (MUX) and AQUA/TERRA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing satellite sensors.


In summary, BDC catalogs and distributes data from the mentioned satellite sensors, as well as the preprocessed to surface reflectance images and processed products. The processed products are data cube collections, which standardize images through merge, reprojection, grid data to a common tiling system, mask clouds and cloud shadows and may apply temporal compositing functions. The available image collections and data cube collections are:

BDC Naming
----------


.. _dc_collection_naming:

Data Cube Collection Naming
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++


Each BDC Data Cube Collection is named following the convention:

<Satellite Sensor Alias>-<Time Step>*-<Version>


**Satellite Sensor Alias** is an alias to an image collection satellite e. g. S2, LC8, C4, representing Sentinel-2, Landsat-8 and CBERS-4, respectively. Note that a full description of the product can be found on its documentation.


**Time Step** only is required when the data cube is time-composed. The Time Step is represented in naming by an integer followed by a capital letter, which can be *D*, *M* or *Y*, representing day, month and year, respectively;


**Version** indicates the product version.


Examples of Data Cube names are: S2-16D-2 (Composed), S2-2 (Identity).


Data Cube Collection File Naming
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


<Data Cube Collection>_<Version>_<Tile>_<Start Period>_<Band>.tif

- **Data Cube Collection** is an alias indicating a BDC data cube collection;


- **Version** is the version of the Data Cube;


- **Tile** is the code of a grid cell that contains the image;


- **Start Period** is written as year-month-day and refers the first date of the compositing period;


- **Band** indicates the file band


.tif indicate the file format, Cloud Optimized Geotiff (COG) in this case.


The file name "S2-16D_V2_008013_20220101_B01.tif", for instance, represents a cube composed by images from the S2-16D_V2 data cube collection, which is an alias to S2-16D-2. This name indicates that it is a Sentinel-2 data cube (S2), using a time compositing function each 16 days (16D), version 2, from a tile with code 008013, which indicates Path (008) and Row (013), starting in January 01, specifically the coastal band image (B01).

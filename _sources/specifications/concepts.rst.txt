BDC Concepts
------------


**CUBE COLLECTION**: A collection of CUBEs (see bellow) with the following constraints: (a) it is associated with only one Geographic Reference System (GRS) that organizes the spatial dimension; (b) it is associated with a temporal schema (COMPOSITE SCHEMA) that organizes the temporal dimension; (c) it is associated with an attribute set (BANDS) that specifies the metadata of the ASSETs values.


**CUBE**: A four-dimensional dense matrix (x, y, t, bands), in which any cell have only one value. A CUBE is associated with a TILE (see next).


**ASSET**: A reference to a two-dimensional dense matrix (x, y) associated to a time (t) and a band of a CUBE ITEM.


**BAND**: A description of the matrix band values and data storage.


**GRS**: A geographic reference system that divides the space into regions (TILE) and uses a code system, specified by a set of numbers, letters, or symbols, to identify an unique region.


**TILE**: It is an element of a GRS, associated with a unique code, that represents a geographic region.


**COMPOSITE FUNCTION**: Is a function that determines a pixel value, according to a heuristic, from a set of pixels contained within a time interval.

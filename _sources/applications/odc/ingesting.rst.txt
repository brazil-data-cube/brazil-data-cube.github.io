Data Ingestion
===============

With the products and their cataloged datasets, it is possible to perform a data ingestion process. In this process, transformations such as ``reprojection`` and ``tiling`` can be applied to the data to be simpler to be loaded by the ODC and become more usual for different user analyses.

As in all other steps presented in this tutorial, the completion of the ingestion process requires a YAML file. For this case, ``stac2odc`` has no utilities available yet

To get around this issue and make the ingestion process easy, use the file `CB4_64_16D_STK-1.ingest.yaml <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brazil-data-cube/bdc-odc/master/config/datacube-core/ingest/CB4_64_16D_STK-1.ingest.yaml>`_ is shown below, which contains the description of this operation.

.. note::

    More YAML for ingestion is available in `bdc-odc repository <https://github.com/brazil-data-cube/bdc-odc>`_.

The ingestion process present in the file ``CB4_64_16D_STK-1.ingest.yaml`` performs the data's ``compression`` and applies ``tiling`` so that the data's recovery is made faster. The generation of the ingestion is presented below::

    sudo datacube -v ingest \
                  -c CB4_64_16D_STK-1.ingest.yaml \
                  --executor multiproc 2


Besides the option ``--executor``, applied in the above command, several others can be used to accelerate the ingestion process and guarantee its reproducibility. For more information, consult the `ODC documentation <https://datacube-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ops/ingest.html>`_.

Web Time Series Services (WTSS)
===============================


**W**\ eb **T**\ ime **S**\ eries **S**\ ervice (WTSS) is a lightweight web service for handling time series data from remote sensing imagery. Given a location and a time interval you can retrieve the according time series as a JSON array of numbers.


In WTSS a coverage is a three dimensional array associated to spatial and temporal reference systems (:numref:`Figure %s <wtss:coverage>`).

Retrieving Trajectory
========================


The Python :numref:`Code snippet %s <wlts:tj-retrieve>` shows how to retrieve a trajectory for the location with ``longitude = -54.0`` and ``latitude = -12.0`` for the collection `MapBiomas <https://brasil.mapbiomas.org/en/>`_ and `TerraClass <https://www.terraclass.gov.br/>`_:


.. code-block:: python
    :caption: Retrieving trajectory.
    :linenos:
    :name: wlts:tj-retrieve

    import wlts

    service = wlts.WLTS('http://brazildatacube.dpi.inpe.br/wlts')

    tj = service.tj(latitude=-12.0, longitude=-54.0, collections='mapbiomas5_amazonia,terraclass_amazonia')

    tj.df()


The output of the above code snippet is a dataframe with trajectory of land use and cover as shown in :numref:`Figure %s <wlts:ts-df_plot>`:

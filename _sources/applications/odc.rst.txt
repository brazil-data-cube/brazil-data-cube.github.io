The Open Data Cube (ODC) framework and all its tools ecosystem are currently being tested with Brazil Data Cube (BDC) data products. This integration aims to increase the set of access, visualization, and analysis tools available to the users of the various data cubes produced by the project.

This section presents the steps to configure the ODC-Core and the database to store metadata used by the ODC. Both are essential components for the use of the ODC functionality. Also, ways to perform ingestion of the data cataloged in the ODC are presented.
